In the project directory, you can run:

  1. npm run sass-dev 
    for compiling sass files for development purposes. It isn't compressed, has a source map and a watcher(to run and watch for changes until we stop it).

  2. npm run sass-prod
    for compiling sass files for production purposes. It's compressed, doesn't have a source map, and runs only once.
